## Git and GitHub
**_Git_** is an open-source tool used for version control management, which helps track changes in code and allows multiple people to work on the same project efficiently. On the other hand, **_GitHub_** is a cloud-based service built on top of Git and owned by Microsoft. It manages the servers and hardware needed to host Git repositories, making it easier for developers to collaborate, share code, and store their projects online. **Basically, Git handles the version control, while GitHub provides an online platform to use those Git features conveniently.**
